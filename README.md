## üìå Objective

A fictional aerospace company, SpaceY, wants to compete with SpaceX by reusing rocket boosters. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing to help reduce launch costs.

---

## üìä Executive Summary

- Collected and combined data from SpaceX's public API and Wikipedia page.
- Processed data using SQL, Pandas, and visualization tools.
- Created new features and transformed categorical data using one-hot encoding.
- Trained four ML models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN.
- Achieved ~83.33% accuracy; all models slightly overpredicted successful landings.
- Developed an interactive dashboard and Folium maps for visualization.

## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** API requests and web scraping
2. **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned and formatted datasets
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using SQL and visualization libraries
4. **Visualization:** Interactive maps with Folium and dashboard with Plotly Dash
5. **Modeling:** Classification models tuned using GridSearchCV

---

## üìà Results

- **Accuracy:** ~83.33% on all four models (LogReg, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN)
- **Key Finding:** Models tend to overpredict successful landings
- **Best Launch Site:** KSC LC-39A had the highest success rate
- **Feature Importance:** Payload mass and orbit type significantly impact outcomes

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- Built an end-to-end predictive ML model for rocket landing success.
- Enabled data-driven decision making for SpaceY‚Äôs launch attempts.
- Suggested improvements: gather more data, use ensemble methods, integrate weather features.
